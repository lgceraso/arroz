1595367773	Search For Patterns Within Files With Grep	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N05sWPgj-44	One of the most important command line utilities that every Linux user should know is Grep.  Grep searches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a specified pattern. By default, Grep outputs the matching lines but it has a ton of flags and options available. \n\nERRATA:\nI mentioned that Grep doesn't like binaries.  That's not entirely true.  There is a way to grep a binary as if it were a text file by using the "-a" flag.  One thing to note though is many binaries are just one gigantic line so a lot of the time, all you are going to get is the equivalent of a "cat binary-file".\n\nREFERENCED:\n► https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/ - GNU Grep\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n💳 Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=derek%40distrotube%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=DistroTube&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest\n🛍️ Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n👕 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nSOCIAL PLATFORMS: \n🗨️ Mastodon: https://mastodon.technology/@distrotube \n💬 IRC: irc://freenode #distrotube\n👫 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n📽️ LBRY: https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@DistroTube:2\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n🕸️ Website: http://distrotube.com/\n🐿️ Gopherhole: gopher://distro.tube\n📁 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n🌐 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n📽️ Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n🎬 Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n🎨 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n🔊 Audacity: https://www.audacityteam.org/\n💻 VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.

Today, I'm taking a look at the recently released Slackel 7.3 Openbox.\n \nREFERENCED:\n► http://www.slackel.gr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=612 - Release Announcement\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n💳 Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=derek%40distrotube%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=DistroTube&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest\n🛍️ Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n👕 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nSOCIAL PLATFORMS: \n🗨️ Mastodon: https://mastodon.technology/@distrotube \n💬 IRC: irc://freenode #distrotube\n👫 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n📽️ LBRY: https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@DistroTube:2\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n🕸️ Website: http://distrotube.com/\n🐿️ Gopherhole: gopher://distro.tube\n📁 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n🌐 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n📽️ Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n🎬 Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n🎨 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n🔊 Audacity: https://www.audacityteam.org/\n💻 VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.

This will be an attempt at performing the Handel Recorder Sonata in G minor (opus 1, no. 2).  As I haven't played lately, this will not be a flawless  performance, but that's the point.  I think it's important to show mistakes made in my Linux videos, and the same can be said for my music videos.  \n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n💳 Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr...\n🛍️ Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n👕 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nSOCIAL PLATFORMS: \n🗨️ Mastodon: https://mastodon.technology/@distrotube \n💬 IRC: irc://freenode #distrotube\n👫 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n📽️ LBRY: https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@DistroTube:2\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n🕸️ Website: http://distrotube.com/\n🐿️ Gopherhole: gopher://distro.tube\n📁 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n🌐 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n📽️ Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n🎬 Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n🎨 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n🔊 Audacity: https://www.audacityteam.org/\n💻 VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.
