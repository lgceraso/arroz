1594645230	The Virgin YouTube vs. the Chad PeerTube	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrEwHn7XmRU	I'm started to host my most based and red-pilled videos on a PeerTube instance I have on my website: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz. PeerTube is a federated video system: meaning you can host your own videos and connect to other PeerTube instances. It has all the features of YouTube and more and is torrent based to minimize bandwidth usage.\n\nThis will cost me money to maintain, but again, I'll be able to do more stuff when I don't have to worried about YouTube's expanding and purposefully ambiguous terms of service.

1593172811	Installing Artix Linux (Like Arch, but better)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCc_4fSYzRA	I needed to reinstall Artix Linux on my (UEFI) desktop, so  went through the process here. It's basically the same as installing Arch, but with minor changes which I'll note. Artix is just Arch without systemd: it allows OpenRC, runit or s6. Get the distribution here: https://artixlinux.org/ I did the minimal install, similar to how Arch Linux is usually installed, but there are also many desktop environment ISOs including Cinnamon, Plasma, XFCE, i3 and more which should be even easier to install.\n\nOnce you have the minimal install done, you can install a graphical environment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSHOb8YU9Gw\n\nThere are only several differences between this and an Arch install: some commands are named differently: `genfstab` in Arch while `fstabgen` in Artix, `basestrap` in Artix, while `pacstrap` in Arch. Obviously the commands to autostart services will be different since we have a different init system. Note that I install this for a UEFI machine, but a machine running traditional BIOS should just be one or two commands different. UEFI machines must have a FAT32 boot partition and a different grub install command.\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz 🌐❓🔎\nDONATE: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate 💰😎👌💯\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke View my videos on LBRY.\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/join/smith_5to1 Get crypto-rich on Coinbase.	plain	yt:video:nCc_4fSYzRA	Luke Smith

I installed it on my computer to do testing of LARBS, but it ended up being so seamless I kept it on, despite the fact that I am a confirmed soystemd shill who has defended it in the past.\n\nIt has OpenRC, runit and s6 versions (I use runit).

If you get a domain name from the link above I get some Epik credit so I can continue to keep my domains up after I die lol\n\nTo host a website, get a VPS. I use Vultr (https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G). That link gives you a free one month credit of $100 to play around with whatever want for then. There are other VPS hosts like Linode and Digital Ocean that are common and good as well.
